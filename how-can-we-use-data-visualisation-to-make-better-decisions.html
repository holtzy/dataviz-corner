The first page of the introduction states that \u003cem\u003e\u0026#8220;The Big Picture is for the 99 percent of business professionals who don\u0026#8217;t create data visualisations, but who need to be able to decipher, understand, and see the value of charts and dashboards if they are to survive, let alone thrive, during the never-ending data deluge.\u0026#8221;\u003c/em\u003e In other words, the book is aimed at chart readers, not chart creators.

I bought the book to improve my own chart-creating skill and to learn valuable lessons from the author. And it\u0026#8217;s not just me, I know of many other people who have bought the book, either people at work, or in my wider professional network. In every one of those cases, we are talking about chart creators, not chart looker-atters. And if you\u0026#8217;re a reader or follower of this blog, the chances are that best describes you as well. In other words, I am firmly within the \u0026#8220;bubble\u0026#8221; of the 1%, not the 99%.
