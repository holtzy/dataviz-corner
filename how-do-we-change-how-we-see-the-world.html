For every traditional or near-traditional map visualisation, there\u0026#8217;s a chart that\u0026#8217;s either a much less traditional stylised map view, or a chart that\u0026#8217;s nothing to do with a map. But what every image does have in common (and there are a lot of images), is that they country or region related information in an eye-catching manner. Because of that it\u0026#8217;s a book I love to pick up and browse through. It\u0026#8217;s a joy to own, read and take inspiration from, while being very difficult to pin down to a specific genre or description to base a review around. In other words, every time I pick the book up to review it, I browse through, find something different, and get thoroughly immersed in it again, without writing a word! \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLike a few other books I\u0026#8217;ve reviewed, the book has a visual display of contents \u0026#8211; like every other book that\u0026#8217;s included one of these, I love it!
