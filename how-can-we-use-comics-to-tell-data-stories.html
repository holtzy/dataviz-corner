The book is a delightful read, split into two parts. The first section, described as a graphic novel, interweaves data and visualisation with an ongoing story in comic form, documenting the ups and downs of a few days in the life of Ringo and Priya, living in London, along with their friends, Dey and Dev, in Bengaluru, and other characters we are introduced to along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there’s no getting away from the fact that the subject of the comic is cricket–specifically the 2019 T20 World Cup in England. Cricket is a strong theme to the book, since the human comic story and the data-heavy tournament story run concurrently. If, like me, you know, understand, and enjoy cricket, then I think you will enjoy the book tremendously. Cricket, like baseball and other similar sports, is exceptionally data heavy, with statistics available on every ball, shot, catch, wicket, player, match, and team. The longer nature of individual matches, not to mention the tournament as a whole, offers the opportunity to tell a full and detailed story with data over the course of every game. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"4867\" data-permalink=\"https://questionsindataviz.com/image-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://questionsindataviz.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/image-1.png\" data-orig-size=\"1242,870\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://questionsindataviz.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/image-1.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://questionsindataviz.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/image-1.png?w=680\" src=\"https://questionsindataviz.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/image-1.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4867\" srcset=\"https://questionsindataviz.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/image-1.png?w=1024 1024w, https://questionsindataviz.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/image-1.png?w=150 150w, https://questionsindataviz.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/image-1.png?w=300 300w, https://questionsindataviz.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/image-1.png?w=768 768w, https://questionsindataviz.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/image-1.png 1242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eImage from the book\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis first section is in the form of a comic in several chapters. Each chapter represents the timing on and around the day of one particular match, which offers an ideal opportunity to tell a story broken down into bite-sized parts. The comic book style allows each chapter to begin with the latest update in the tale of the comic characters, while then moving on to the story of the specific match, accompanied by visual scorecards and other charts to complement and enhance the narrative. A brief data comic tip starts each chapter, with advice on topics such as connecting tables to visualisations with arrows, or showing emotion on characters’ faces aligned to time series graphs to accentuate findings in the data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEach chapter contains visualised scorecards, and it’s the ball-by-ball nature of the scorecards, forming the bulk of the data visualisation, which allows the story to be told in detail, almost as if you were at the match!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ubfWti-xMRnnF8GRMiq7wuLgRAs18pflQu8JCX9aRY3S_KlfNeM6UJiZDa2KhIfvhhBzW0OY8orQEv8ChQ1VntZ4U6rxxScTg84O6ZZ-Kq6k_6cTEo3A4eEpMINfS3vSb58_oiol\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eCombinations of comic strips, emotions, stats, annotations, and hand-drawn graphs combine to tell compelling data stories.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe book itself demonstrates of how\u0026nbsp;gently and seamlessly mixing visual and storytelling techniques can produce a successful data visualisation.

I see no reason why it wouldn’t be possible to visualise similar sport tournaments (FIFA World Cup, Olympics, or Paralympics) or a data-heavy TV series, for example.
