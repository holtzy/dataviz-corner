Although I was familiar and confident with all the office tasks from my previous job experience, I was completely new to the data vis world when I started here last July. I had no experience beyond the normal bar chart or pie chart that you learn about in school. While I have to say the education about charts in my school was fairly good in terms of pointing out the statistics behind it,\u0026nbsp;or how to judge charts based on the possible bias of the source, it was never part of the curriculum to build charts yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI have done \u003ca href=\"https://blog.datawrapper.de/livnah-datawrapper-new-hire/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eone simple pie chart\u003c/a\u003e with the Datawrapper tool so far.

She is well known to most people as a nurse and healthcare practitioner, the ‚Äúlady with the lamp.‚Äù As a 25-year-old in 1854, she traveled with 37 other volunteer nurses from London to Scutari (today‚Äôs Istanbul), where wounded soldiers were sent back from the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_War\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eCrimean War\u003c/a\u003e for treatment.

Note that ‚Äúgerm theory,‚Äù which is absolutely plausible for everyone today, would not be proven for decades after that time. She wrote a whole report to send to Queen Victoria of England to convince her of the importance of sanitation and the need for supplies like clean bandages and alcohol, and to discourage practices like sending medical officers to fight at the front instead of keeping them to practice medicine in the hospitals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eShe later collected all her reports from the Crimean War in the book ‚ÄúNotes on matters affecting the health, efficiency, and hospital administration of the British Army,‚Äù which is still \u003ca href=\"https://wellcomecollection.org/works/jxwtskzc/items?canvas=9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eavailable to read online\u003c/a\u003e.

(Zymotic is an old medical term from the 19th century meaning infectious diseases like typhus, typhoid fever, smallpox, etc.) A lot more soldiers were dying due to infection than due to actual wounds from battle. February and March of 1855 is when Florence Nightingale finally managed to implement better standards of sanitation after being hindered by the standing policies of what nurses were and weren't allowed to do. Right away, deaths from disease started to go down again as you can see in her chart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn absolutely great and beautiful visualization by Florence Nightingale. Now here is my visualization of the same data:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"\u003e\n\u003ciframe title=\"Recreating Florence Nightingale\u0026#039;s Rose Chart\" aria-label=\"Grouped Column Chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-3VzsE\" class= \"lazyload\" data-src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3VzsE/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"600\" data-external=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\"\u003e!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\u003ct.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI tried a little different approach with a linear timeline and grouping the numbers instead of overlapping them. In the rose chart, all the pieces start from the vertex in the middle, so in some months it is hard to distinguish the different colored areas (for example in December ‚Äò54, when the black area is slightly bigger than the red). I also added the baseline of a military hospital in London, which Nightingale also mentions in her book, for better comparison than the Manchester hospitals where the broad average population was treated (including infants and senior citizens), and I marked the change to Nightingale‚Äôs improvements in February/March of 1855.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI was eager to learn more about Florence Nightingale‚Äôs impact on the health care system and the overall history of data visualization.

While I have to say the education about charts in my school was fairly good in terms of pointing out the statistics behind it,¬†or how to judge charts based on the possible bias of the source, it was never part of the curriculum to build charts yourself.\nI have done one simple pie chart with the Datawrapper tool so far. In this case a very simple pie chart was sufficient because the point I wanted to bring across was very simple üôÇ (Hire me: yes and yes.)\nSo for this week, I decided to prepare for my first Weekly Chart duty by reading some classic books about the history and the beginnings of¬†data visualization ‚Äî Edward Tufte‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Visual Display of Quantitative Information‚Äù and Darrel Huff‚Äôs ‚ÄúHow to Lie with Statistics.‚Äù Through all the history that I looked at, these four historical charts got mentioned the most: William Playfair‚Äôs import/export graph in the field of state finance, Charles Minard‚Äôs ‚ÄúMarch to Russia‚Äù military map, John Snow‚Äôs cholera map, and Florence Nightingale‚Äôs ‚Äúrose‚Äù charts in the field of science and healthcare.\n\n\n\n\nI remembered learning about Florence Nightingale years ago at the museum about her life in London. She is well known to most people as a nurse and healthcare practitioner, the ‚Äúlady with the lamp.‚Äù As a 25-year-old in 1854, she traveled with 37 other volunteer nurses from London to Scutari (today‚Äôs Istanbul), where wounded soldiers were sent back from the Crimean War for treatment. What I completely missed, or just didn‚Äôt remember, were her contributions in statistics and changing the sanitary conditions in hospitals all over Britain and consequently the world. So I decided to do some more research on her and take her famous roses as a model for this week‚Äôs Weekly Chart.\nIn this painting, The Mission of Mercy: Florence Nightingale receiving the Wounded at Scutari, you can even see animal carcasses lying on the floor in the entrance way where the wounded soldiers were admitted. At the museum I was also amazed by a taxidermied version of her pet owl, which she found wounded and nursed back to health like most of her patients.\n\n\n\nDuring her work she meticulously kept track of everything ‚Äî nutrition, arriving shipments, causes of death, and especially her suspicions about the relationship of unsanitary conditions to the high rate of deaths among soldiers. Note that ‚Äúgerm theory,‚Äù which is absolutely plausible for everyone today, would not be proven for decades after that time. She wrote a whole report to send to Queen Victoria of England to convince her of the importance of sanitation and the need for supplies like clean bandages and alcohol, and to discourage practices like sending medical officers to fight at the front instead of keeping them to practice medicine in the hospitals.\nShe later collected all her reports from the Crimean War in the book ‚ÄúNotes on matters affecting the health, efficiency, and hospital administration of the British Army,‚Äù which is still available to read online. It includes many tables of data and some visualizations to make her findings and numbers more understandable and appealing.\n\n\n\n\nProbably the most famous are her ‚Äúrose‚Äù diagrams. This gray one shows the mortality rates (per year, out of 1000) among soldiers compared with the mortality rate of normal people in Manchester, which Nightingale describes as one of the unhealthiest cities in Britain during that time. At first I couldn‚Äôt see the source of the numbers she used in this chart, but when I copied her tables into Datawrapper and added a summary column, it became clear to me that she used this visualization as an extension of her tables, showing total deaths from all causes together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\n\n\n\n\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\n\n\n\n\nThe next one is probably her most famous chart: a blue, black and red rose. At first, the explanation of the data seemed simple ‚Äî the war is progressing and more soldiers are being killed, then the war is coming to an end so fewer soldiers are dying. But take a closer look the composition of different causes of death!\nMonths with zero deaths from wounds are Nightingale‚Äôs traveling time away from the front.\n\n\n\nYou can see that a majority of deaths are actually from ‚ÄúZymotic disease,‚Äù in blue. (Zymotic is an old medical term from the 19th century meaning infectious diseases like typhus, typhoid fever, smallpox, etc.) A lot more soldiers were dying due to infection than due to actual wounds from battle. February and March of 1855 is when Florence Nightingale finally managed to implement better standards of sanitation after being hindered by the standing policies of what nurses were and weren't allowed to do. Right away, deaths from disease started to go down again as you can see in her chart.\nAn absolutely great and beautiful visualization by Florence Nightingale. Now here is my visualization of the same data:\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\n\n\n\n\nI tried a little different approach with a linear timeline and grouping the numbers instead of overlapping them. In the rose chart, all the pieces start from the vertex in the middle, so in some months it is hard to distinguish the different colored areas (for example in December ‚Äò54, when the black area is slightly bigger than the red). I also added the baseline of a military hospital in London, which Nightingale also mentions in her book, for better comparison than the Manchester hospitals where the broad average population was treated (including infants and senior citizens), and I marked the change to Nightingale‚Äôs improvements in February/March of 1855.\nI was eager to learn more about Florence Nightingale‚Äôs impact on the health care system and the overall history of data visualization. It was a good challenge to learn more about the Datawrapper tool and it makes me wonder how hard it must have been for Florence Nightingale to make visualizations just with pen, paper, and math skills.\nThat‚Äôs it from me. I‚Äôll be back in a few months when it‚Äôs my turn for the Weekly Chart again. Hope to learn lots more about data vis in the meantime.
