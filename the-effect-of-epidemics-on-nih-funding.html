Also, lentivirus-derived vectors are commonly used as tools for genetic modification in research that has nothing to do with HIV, so I didn’t want to include that. Although AIDS had some history prior to 1985, the virus name “HIV” was not coined by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses until 1986. Up through 2010, HIV has had a sharp increase in research funding, except for the period of 1999–2003. In recent years it has waned a bit, but still received enormous amounts of research funding compared to the other viruses that have since emerged (except SARS-CoV-2).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e“Influenza”\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eInfluenza itself is nothing new, being the persistent threat to humanity that it is. But new strains of significant concern have emerged in recent years. On the graph I marked two in particular. The H5N1 Avian Flu caused quite a scare in 2003–2004 when it spread widely through the poultry population in Asia and spilled over into humans, killing a few people. This seemed to trigger an increase in influenza funding. Then in 2009 a new type of H1N1 influenza was first noticed on pig farms in Mexico as it spread globally into the human population, killing thousands of people. Influenza funding has remained at higher levels since then.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e“Coronavirus”\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eResearch funding for coronaviruses hardly registered until the SARS outbreak in China during 2002 to 2004. There was a somewhat delayed response in research funding that followed afterward, peaking around 2009. Then MERS emerged in 2012. Interestingly, research for coronaviruses didn’t peak after that, but it did remain on a plateau above where it was before SARS. Of course, everything changed with SARS-CoV-2 in 2020. This resulted in probably the most immediate and dramatic shift in research funding for any virus as several emergency funding programs were created in response. We’ve seen the effects of this as researchers in just about every field had a COVID-related project by 2021. It will be interesting to see where coronavirus research funding goes in the years ahead, as new COVID variants and new coronaviruses emerge.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e“Flavivirus”\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis group includes many of the mosquito viruses that have been of increasing concern, and some tick viruses as well. West Nile virus wasn’t seen in the U.S. until 1999, and that seems to have spurred some slight increases in funding. There were very few human cases of Zika virus until an outbreak in the Polynesian islands in 2007–2008, followed by the much larger spread to the Western hemisphere and other places around 2015. Both Zika outbreaks seemed to trigger increases in flavivirus research funding, but ongoing threats such as dengue and yellow fever virus may have had more to do with the increase in funding prior to 2010.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e“Poxvirus”\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eSmallpox was declared eradicated in 1980, but some lingering research interest probably remained afterwards for smallpox and its cousins cowpox and monkeypox (but not chickenpox, which is actually in a different family of viruses). A large bump in funding for poxviruses in 2007 might be explained as a delayed response to the unusual 2003 case of monkeypox spreading to some midwestern U.S. states via the pet trade and some infected prairie dogs that came from Ghana. But this was rather isolated, resulting in less than 100 confirmed cases and no human-to-human transmission. So the bump in research funding that followed could have also been related to the gradual increase in monkeypox cases in various regions of Africa. Following the global spread of human-to-human cases in 2022 and many related questions, we should expect to see a lot more funding for poxviruses in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e“Filovirus”\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eEbola is a terrible disease with a high mortality rate, as is its cousin Marburg virus.
