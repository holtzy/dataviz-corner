They will either tout their legislative record, be criticized for it by their opponents, or most likely both. It may be hard to gauge the quality of bills passed in any general way, but we can gauge the quantity of bills that each of the 100 Senators has brought to fruition to get a sense of how much legislation these legislators are actually doing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI pulled data from \u003ca href=\"https://www.congress.gov/sponsors-cosponsors/117th-congress/senators/ALL\"\u003econgress.gov\u003c/a\u003e on how many bills each Senator has sponsored that have made it all the way through congress, to the President’s desk, and been signed into law. And similarly, I also pulled data on how many bills signed into law that each Senator has co-sponsored. These two metrics can at least give some indication of the Senators’ legislative leadership and cooperative abilities, respectively. Then I divided the number of bills sponsored or co-sponsored by the number of years they have served in the Senate, to get an idea of the rate at which they are producing new legislation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s what that looks like:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wvzvQTOvdSQYLrnsdBYCCA.png\" /\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vuPMukqcbCBZ2ya9hl87tQ.png\" /\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, this data carries more weight for Senators that have served for several years vs. those who are new to the Senate. Also, it is worth noting that Senators do many things besides sponsor legislation, such as leading committees, taking on the role of majority or minority leader, or going on cable news to get attention. So it may not be entirely surprising that many of the Senators with the most name recognition are more likely to be found at the bottom rather than the top of these lists. A case in point is Democrat Gary Peters, who is not a household name outside of the state of Michigan where he serves as the junior senator. During his seven years so far in the Senate, Peters has already sponsored 24 bills that have become law, which puts his rate of nearly 3.4 bills sponsored into law per year in the Senate way past everyone else in that regard.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Democrats in the Senate have a slight edge in the number of bills they have sponsored into law, but not by much. They have a larger margin in the number of bills on which they have collaborated as co-sponsors. Collectively, the Democrats in the Senate have 600 years experience vs. 565 years for Republicans. So, the rate at which all Democrats have sponsored legislation into law is 0.658 bills per year, vs. 0.644 for Republicans. And Democrats are featured as co-sponsors on bills signed into law at a rate of 6.907 bills per year, vs. 6.067 for Republicans. So it appears that Democrats are more apt to legislate new bills into law. At least by these metrics, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother way to look at the bar chart data from above is with a scatter plot.
