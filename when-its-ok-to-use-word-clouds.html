The data we got was pretty interesting. For each combination of street name and street suffix, \u003ca href=\"http://zillow.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eZillow\u003c/a\u003e gave us the median home value according to their real estate database.

Let‚Äôs put aside the problem of comparing individual homes with median homes across all streets with the same name (indeed, some readers complained that the data must be wrong, because in \u003cem\u003etheir\u003c/em\u003e city, Main St. clearly is the better place to live on etc.). It‚Äôs still an interesting dataset that you don‚Äôt see every day. So we wanted to do something more with it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the first ideas that popped into my mind was Monopoly. Since we also got a per state and city breakdown of street name values, we could have made a ‚Äòcreate your own Monopoly‚Äô tool easily. Of course, plenty of localized Monopoly boards have been made already, but how many of them select streets based on actual home price value instead of some editorial judgement?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/blog/images/old/ad3a81c55659f70db37c281b444c114d.png\" alt=\"Image by Fir0002/Flagstaffotos, CC BY-NC\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"image-caption\"\u003eImage by Fir0002/Flagstaffotos, CC BY-NC\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, after checking back with our legal team at The Times, we had to dismiss this idea, which probably would not have been covered by the fair-use exception for use of copyrighted material.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I was looking for something else to do with that data. I ran into some problems with simply showing a top x list of streets. Showing the most common streets was easy ‚Äì I forgot to mention that we also got the total number of homes per street name ‚Äì but showing the most valuable street names wasn‚Äôt. Unsurprisingly, the most valuable street names are in fact just some single streets on places like \u003ca href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Indian+Creek+Island+Rd,+Florida+33154/@25.8782246,-80.1323674,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m5!1e2!3m3!1s-v_Bk1EBVp9c%2FVDrzbFMaZNI%2FAAAAAAAAi7k%2F_SKyxFFl9Tc!2e4!3e15!4m2!3m1!1s0x88d9b291246d6ee9:0x80241346eaf539a3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eMiami Beach golf course islands\u003c/a\u003e. So that‚Äôs not really representative. Of course you can just filter out street names with less than X homes, or that appear in at fewer than Y states. But these cuts are arbitrary. The values I ‚Äúpick‚Äù for X and Y will directly change the make-up of the list of most valuable street names (because the top of the list will always include street names that barely make my filter criteria).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis kind of brought me to the idea of showing as many street names as possible. If top 20 list of most common street names is boring, maybe the top 1000 list isn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs where word clouds came into the game first. So mainly for looking at the most common streets I created this word cloud, in which street names are sized by the number of homes, and colored by the median home value (from the least valuable streets in gray to the most valuable ‚Äì among those 1000 streets ‚Äì in dark red):\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/blog/images/old/079894a0fbbd309bdf2e96aecdb65496.png\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd I immediately liked it. Limiting to two angles made it easier to read, and by shifting both angles a bit I reduced the readability disadvantage that the vertical text would have had otherwise. I felt that this form actually encourages to read through hundreds of street names, something that‚Äôs hard to achieve in any other form. Like, reading a thousand street names in an alphabetically ordered list is boring, ordering them by number of homes puts the more valuable streets at the bottom, making the list sortable makes it harder to visually memorize the location of streets, etc. The word cloud solves all these problems. But we weren‚Äôt quite there yet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter all, by increasing the number of streets shown to a thousand I didn‚Äôt really solve my arbitrary filter problem. And by focussing on the most common streets I lose the interesting pattern of ‚Äòrich‚Äô street names.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat‚Äôs when I got back to Monopoly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf we can‚Äôt use the Monopoly idea, perhaps I can find out what exactly I liked of it. Of course, the idea is without doubt the most fun view on street names, and with the game \u003ca href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/BoardGamePatentMagie.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ebeing around for more than a century\u003c/a\u003e, the view is also immediately familiar to a wide audience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut what‚Äôs really great about Monopoly is the diversity of street names. The Monopoly board doesn‚Äôt just show the richest streets. It shows the most common (or at least recognizable) street names in eight different groups of street value (each with its own color). As if it wanted to include people from all levels of society, lower incomes, the middle class and the richest one percent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt this point I had enough to make the word clouds work. By splitting the data up into sub-groups I was able to see the most common street names for different home values. Just like a Monopoly board, but with hundreds of streets in each cluster. The initially break-down into five equally sized groups (by of number of homes) was later I changed to a three group split, mainly because I felt the differences between the ‚Äòmiddle groups‚Äô wasn‚Äôt interesting enough to justify the extra panels.
