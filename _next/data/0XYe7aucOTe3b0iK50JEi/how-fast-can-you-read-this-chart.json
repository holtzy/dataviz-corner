When I was first looking at the visualisation, it took me no more than 30 seconds to start commenting on some of the most interesting data points.

I also wondered if the median age in Afghanistan was impacted by the long-lasting war and turmoil.</p><p>I didn&#8217;t realise I was reading the chart very quickly until my friend said something.

But that&#8217;s not the case for most of our readers, is it? Hence<strong> the reader always takes longer to read the chart than its creator.</strong></p><p>Now that&#8217;s quite something to keep in mind. </p><p>If we wanted to help our readers decipher our chart quicker though, what could we do?
