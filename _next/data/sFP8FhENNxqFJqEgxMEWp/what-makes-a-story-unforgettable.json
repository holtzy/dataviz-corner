I brought it with me to Costa Rica as a casual holiday read, and ended up devouring over 300 pages in just a few days. While outside during the day, I waited impatiently to get my hands (or eyes &#128521;) on the next chapter. In the evening, I read until my eyes literally closed shut for sleep.</p><p>I&#8217;m convinced that the success of the book is at least partly due to its structure. It pulls you in right away. Each chapter beginning feels like a new exciting story. And each chapter ending is as painful as a season finale cliffhanger on Netflix. So it got me thinking &#8212; what if our data stories were structured this well?</p><h2>Structure, but how?</h2><p>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve been told at some point in your life that a story should have three parts. It has to include a beginning, a middle and an end. That&#8217;s a good basis for a story flow. But what should you put <em>inside</em> these three sections? That&#8217;s the tricky part. In this second newsletter of the storytelling series, I&#8217;ll share my three go-to resources for structuring data narratives.</p><h2>Follow the media</h2><p>You won&#8217;t be surprised to hear that journalists are great storytellers. They&#8217;re also often pioneers of innovation in data visualisation, and that includes structuring visual narratives. So it would be a shame not to learn from them! My favourite resource on narrative data structures in journalism is <a href=\"https://youtu.be/b5JT9saUl3E\">this talk</a> by Gurman Bhatia. She explains five different story flows &#8212; from pyramids to martini glasses to kebabs and beyond. I think the inverted pyramid (shown below) is probably the most versatile.  I trained the data team at Dior this summer to use it for their dashboards, and it worked great!</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link is-viewable-img image2\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa8343fc0-52e2-4363-8b97-fa47ce7fc36b_1024x768.jpeg\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa8343fc0-52e2-4363-8b97-fa47ce7fc36b_1024x768.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa8343fc0-52e2-4363-8b97-fa47ce7fc36b_1024x768.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa8343fc0-52e2-4363-8b97-fa47ce7fc36b_1024x768.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa8343fc0-52e2-4363-8b97-fa47ce7fc36b_1024x768.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa8343fc0-52e2-4363-8b97-fa47ce7fc36b_1024x768.jpeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a8343fc0-52e2-4363-8b97-fa47ce7fc36b_1024x768.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:768,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:49451,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa8343fc0-52e2-4363-8b97-fa47ce7fc36b_1024x768.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa8343fc0-52e2-4363-8b97-fa47ce7fc36b_1024x768.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa8343fc0-52e2-4363-8b97-fa47ce7fc36b_1024x768.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa8343fc0-52e2-4363-8b97-fa47ce7fc36b_1024x768.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" y1=\"3\" x2=\"14\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" y1=\"21\" x2=\"10\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">The inverted pyramid story structure as presented by Gurman Bhatia&#8217;s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/b5JT9saUl3E\">at World IA day 2021</a></figcaption></figure></div><h2>Get inspired by orators</h2><p>If this is not the first time you&#8217;re reading The Plot, you already know that I&#8217;m a big fan of great public speaking.
