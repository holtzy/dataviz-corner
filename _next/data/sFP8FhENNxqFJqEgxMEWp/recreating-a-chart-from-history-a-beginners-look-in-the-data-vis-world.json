This week I’m bringing you my first Weekly Chart and second visualization from the Datawrapper tool.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been working at Datawrapper for the past six months now. Although I was familiar and confident with all the office tasks from my previous job experience, I was completely new to the data vis world when I started here last July. I had no experience beyond the normal bar chart or pie chart that you learn about in school. While I have to say the education about charts in my school was fairly good in terms of pointing out the statistics behind it,&nbsp;or how to judge charts based on the possible bias of the source, it was never part of the curriculum to build charts yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have done <a href=\"https://blog.datawrapper.de/livnah-datawrapper-new-hire/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one simple pie chart</a> with the Datawrapper tool so far. In this case a very simple pie chart was sufficient because the point I wanted to bring across was very simple 🙂 (Hire me: yes and yes.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for this week, I decided to prepare for my first Weekly Chart duty by reading some classic books about the history and the beginnings of&nbsp;data visualization — Edward Tufte’s “The Visual Display of Quantitative Information” and Darrel Huff’s “How to Lie with Statistics.” Through all the history that I looked at, these four historical charts got mentioned the most: William Playfair’s import/export graph in the field of state finance, Charles Minard’s “March to Russia” military map, <a href=\"https://blog.datawrapper.de/weekly-chart-john-snow-cholera-map-alternative/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">John Snow’s cholera map</a>, and Florence Nightingale’s “rose” charts in the field of science and healthcare.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-large is-style-default\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"766\" src=\"https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1-1024x766.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-32833\" srcset=\"https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1-1024x766.png 1024w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1-300x224.png 300w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1-768x574.png 768w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1-700x523.png 700w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1-1400x1047.png 1400w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1-480x359.png 480w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1-960x718.png 960w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1-60x45.png 60w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1-120x90.png 120w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1-70x52.png 70w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1-140x105.png 140w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1-160x120.png 160w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1-320x239.png 320w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1-850x636.png 850w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1-1240x927.png 1240w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1-575x430.png 575w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1-1150x860.png 1150w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1-640x479.png 640w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1-1280x957.png 1280w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1-305x228.png 305w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1-610x456.png 610w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1-100x75.png 100w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1-200x150.png 200w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1-335x250.png 335w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1-670x501.png 670w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/livnah-nightingale2Artboard-2-1.png 1522w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I remembered learning about Florence Nightingale years ago at the museum about her life in London. She is well known to most people as a nurse and healthcare practitioner, the “lady with the lamp.” As a 25-year-old in 1854, she traveled with 37 other volunteer nurses from London to Scutari (today’s Istanbul), where wounded soldiers were sent back from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_War\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Crimean War</a> for treatment. What I completely missed, or just didn’t remember, were her contributions in statistics and changing the sanitary conditions in hospitals all over Britain and consequently the world. So I decided to do some more research on her and take her famous roses as a model for this week’s Weekly Chart.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-default\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"530\" src=\"https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mw08508.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-32834\" srcset=\"https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mw08508.jpg 800w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mw08508-300x199.jpg 300w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mw08508-768x509.jpg 768w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mw08508-700x464.jpg 700w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mw08508-480x318.jpg 480w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mw08508-60x40.jpg 60w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mw08508-120x80.jpg 120w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mw08508-70x46.jpg 70w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mw08508-140x93.jpg 140w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mw08508-160x106.jpg 160w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mw08508-320x212.jpg 320w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mw08508-575x381.jpg 575w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mw08508-640x424.jpg 640w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mw08508-305x202.jpg 305w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mw08508-610x404.jpg 610w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mw08508-100x66.jpg 100w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mw08508-200x133.jpg 200w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mw08508-335x222.jpg 335w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mw08508-670x444.jpg 670w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><figcaption>In this painting, <a href=\"https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portraitExtended/mw08508/The-Mission-of-Mercy-Florence-Nightingale-receiving-the-Wounded-at-Scutari\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Mission of Mercy: Florence Nightingale receiving the Wounded at Scutari</a>, you can even see animal carcasses lying on the floor in the entrance way where the wounded soldiers were admitted. At the museum I was also amazed by a taxidermied version of her pet owl, which she found wounded and nursed back to health like most of her patients.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>During her work she meticulously kept track of everything — nutrition, arriving shipments, causes of death, and especially her suspicions about the relationship of unsanitary conditions to the high rate of deaths among soldiers. Note that “germ theory,” which is absolutely plausible for everyone today, would not be proven for decades after that time. She wrote a whole report to send to Queen Victoria of England to convince her of the importance of sanitation and the need for supplies like clean bandages and alcohol, and to discourage practices like sending medical officers to fight at the front instead of keeping them to practice medicine in the hospitals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She later collected all her reports from the Crimean War in the book “Notes on matters affecting the health, efficiency, and hospital administration of the British Army,” which is still <a href=\"https://wellcomecollection.org/works/jxwtskzc/items?canvas=9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">available to read online</a>. It includes many tables of data and some visualizations to make her findings and numbers more understandable and appealing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-1024x645.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-32850\" srcset=\"https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-1024x645.png 1024w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-300x189.png 300w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-768x484.png 768w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-1536x968.png 1536w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-2048x1291.png 2048w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-700x441.png 700w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-1400x882.png 1400w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-480x302.png 480w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-960x605.png 960w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-60x38.png 60w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-120x76.png 120w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-70x44.png 70w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-140x88.png 140w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-160x101.png 160w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-320x202.png 320w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-850x536.png 850w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-1700x1071.png 1700w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-1920x1210.png 1920w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-1240x781.png 1240w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-2000x1260.png 2000w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-575x362.png 575w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-1150x725.png 1150w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-640x403.png 640w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-1280x807.png 1280w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-305x192.png 305w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-610x384.png 610w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-100x63.png 100w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-200x126.png 200w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-335x211.png 335w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-12.47.24-1-670x422.png 670w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably the most famous are her “rose” diagrams. This gray one shows the mortality rates (per year, out of 1000) among soldiers compared with the mortality rate of normal people in Manchester, which Nightingale describes as one of the unhealthiest cities in Britain during that time. At first I couldn’t see the source of the numbers she used in this chart, but when I copied her tables into Datawrapper and added a summary column, it became clear to me that she used this visualization as an extension of her tables, showing total deaths from all causes together.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-caption-big\"><img width=\"885\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-885x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-32836\" srcset=\"https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-885x1024.png 885w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-259x300.png 259w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-768x889.png 768w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-1328x1536.png 1328w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-1770x2048.png 1770w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-700x810.png 700w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-1400x1620.png 1400w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-480x555.png 480w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-960x1111.png 960w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-60x69.png 60w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-120x139.png 120w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-70x81.png 70w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-140x162.png 140w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-160x185.png 160w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-320x370.png 320w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-850x983.png 850w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-1700x1967.png 1700w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-1920x2221.png 1920w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-1240x1435.png 1240w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-575x665.png 575w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-1150x1331.png 1150w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-640x740.png 640w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-1280x1481.png 1280w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-305x353.png 305w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-610x706.png 610w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-100x116.png 100w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-200x231.png 200w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-335x388.png 335w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale-670x775.png 670w, https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/table-nightingale.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 885px) 100vw, 885px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper mobile-only\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Excerpt of mortality data from Nightingale&#039;s report\" aria-label=\"Table\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-5MaTv\" class= \"lazyload\" data-src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5MaTv/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0;

This week I’m bringing you my first Weekly Chart and second visualization from the Datawrapper tool.\nI have been working at Datawrapper for the past six months now. Although I was familiar and confident with all the office tasks from my previous job experience, I was completely new to the data vis world when I started here last July. I had no experience beyond the normal bar chart or pie chart that you learn about in school. While I have to say the education about charts in my school was fairly good in terms of pointing out the statistics behind it, or how to judge charts based on the possible bias of the source, it was never part of the curriculum to build charts yourself.\nI have done one simple pie chart with the Datawrapper tool so far. In this case a very simple pie chart was sufficient because the point I wanted to bring across was very simple 🙂 (Hire me: yes and yes.)\nSo for this week, I decided to prepare for my first Weekly Chart duty by reading some classic books about the history and the beginnings of data visualization — Edward Tufte’s “The Visual Display of Quantitative Information” and Darrel Huff’s “How to Lie with Statistics.” Through all the history that I looked at, these four historical charts got mentioned the most: William Playfair’s import/export graph in the field of state finance, Charles Minard’s “March to Russia” military map, John Snow’s cholera map, and Florence Nightingale’s “rose” charts in the field of science and healthcare.\n\n\n\n\nI remembered learning about Florence Nightingale years ago at the museum about her life in London. She is well known to most people as a nurse and healthcare practitioner, the “lady with the lamp.” As a 25-year-old in 1854, she traveled with 37 other volunteer nurses from London to Scutari (today’s Istanbul), where wounded soldiers were sent back from the Crimean War for treatment. What I completely missed, or just didn’t remember, were her contributions in statistics and changing the sanitary conditions in hospitals all over Britain and consequently the world. So I decided to do some more research on her and take her famous roses as a model for this week’s Weekly Chart.\nIn this painting, The Mission of Mercy: Florence Nightingale receiving the Wounded at Scutari, you can even see animal carcasses lying on the floor in the entrance way where the wounded soldiers were admitted. At the museum I was also amazed by a taxidermied version of her pet owl, which she found wounded and nursed back to health like most of her patients.\n\n\n\nDuring her work she meticulously kept track of everything — nutrition, arriving shipments, causes of death, and especially her suspicions about the relationship of unsanitary conditions to the high rate of deaths among soldiers. Note that “germ theory,” which is absolutely plausible for everyone today, would not be proven for decades after that time. She wrote a whole report to send to Queen Victoria of England to convince her of the importance of sanitation and the need for supplies like clean bandages and alcohol, and to discourage practices like sending medical officers to fight at the front instead of keeping them to practice medicine in the hospitals.\nShe later collected all her reports from the Crimean War in the book “Notes on matters affecting the health, efficiency, and hospital administration of the British Army,” which is still available to read online. It includes many tables of data and some visualizations to make her findings and numbers more understandable and appealing.\n\n\n\n\nProbably the most famous are her “rose” diagrams. This gray one shows the mortality rates (per year, out of 1000) among soldiers compared with the mortality rate of normal people in Manchester, which Nightingale describes as one of the unhealthiest cities in Britain during that time. At first I couldn’t see the source of the numbers she used in this chart, but when I copied her tables into Datawrapper and added a summary column, it became clear to me that she used this visualization as an extension of her tables, showing total deaths from all causes together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\n\n\n\n\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\n\n\n\n\nThe next one is probably her most famous chart: a blue, black and red rose. At first, the explanation of the data seemed simple — the war is progressing and more soldiers are being killed, then the war is coming to an end so fewer soldiers are dying. But take a closer look the composition of different causes of death!\nMonths with zero deaths from wounds are Nightingale’s traveling time away from the front.\n\n\n\nYou can see that a majority of deaths are actually from “Zymotic disease,” in blue.
