Naturally, I decided to start over from scratch, which is always more fun than messing with code you wrote like two years ago.

In most charting tools, if you want to edit the labels shown in a chart, you have to go back one step and edit the data table, and you visualize them again and so forth, which kind of sucks. In Chartmaker you can simply edit all texts exactly where you see them in the chart, which makes the editing much easier. <img src=\"/blog/images/old/2-mcm-inline-text-2.gif\" alt=\"inline text editing in chartmaker\"><span class=\"image-caption\">inline text editing in chartmaker</span></p><h2 id=\"direct-selection-of-data-points\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#direct-selection-of-data-points\"><span class=\"header-anchor\">#</span></a> Direct selection of data points</h2><p>In scatterplots like this often it would be nice to highlight some additional data points, but the problem is you don‚Äôt really know which ones you want until you see them all plotted.

So we added a feature that allows adapting charts for different sizes. It works like this: while editing, you can switch between different sizes of your chart and your edits are only applied to the selected size. For instance, you can use the short year format on mobile, or abbreviate state names that fit nicely in the full version but aren‚Äôt fitting on a phone. <img src=\"/blog/images/old/5-mcm-mobile-2.gif\" alt=\"mobiile adaptions\"><span class=\"image-caption\">mobiile adaptions</span></p><h2 id=\"newsroom-integration\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#newsroom-integration\"><span class=\"header-anchor\">#</span></a> Newsroom integration</h2><p>One of the great advantages of building your own internal charting tool is that you can integrate it into your newsroom infrastructure and workflows.
