I&#8217;m a data storyteller and designer and I live in Paris, France. It&#8217;s a real honour to be invited to speak at your conference. Today, we&#8217;ll talk about what makes a good chart.</em></p></blockquote><p>Yawn. &#129393; Did this introduction put you to sleep? I don&#8217;t blame you. This is the most basic (not to say, boring) opening I could come up with for a conference talk. Unfortunately, I hear similar introductions rather often, and I&#8217;m sure you do too. Speakers begin by introducing themselves before they mention anything of interest for the audience. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the audience doesn&#8217;t care that much about you, your job or your life. They care about what you can teach them. They want to learn and to be inspired.</p><p>So let&#8217;s look at three creative ways to open your next presentation that won&#8217;t make your audience yawn. </p><h2>The story</h2><p>People love stories. I know that. You know that. Everyone knows that. So why not use one as an opening? It&#8217;s an easy-to-follow yet compelling means to invite your listeners into your world and to start making a point. At the beginning of his TED talk called <em><a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen\">The best stats you&#8217;ve ever seen</a></em>, Hans Rosling shares his teaching experience. Here is an excerpt:</p><blockquote><p><em>About 10 years ago, I took on the task to teach global development to Swedish undergraduate students. That was after having spent about 20 years, together with African institutions, studying hunger in Africa. So I was sort of expected to know a little about the world. And I started, in our medical university, Karolinska Institute, an undergraduate course called Global Health. But when you get that opportunity, you get a little nervous. I thought, these students coming to us actually have the highest grade you can get in the Swedish college system, so I thought, maybe they know everything I'm going to teach them about. &lt;&#8230;&gt;</em></p></blockquote><p>How do you feel? Do you want to learn more? To find out what the end of the story is and why it&#8217;s important? I bet you do. I strongly recommend watching the <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen\">whole talk</a> to get all the answers! Hint: Hans Rosling realised that most people knew little about the world, and made it his mission to change that. </p><p>If you want another great example,<em> </em>watch how Shonda Rhimes opened her (also super famous) <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/shonda_rhimes_my_year_of_saying_yes_to_everything\">TED talk</a> on saying yes to everything for one year.</p><h2>The visual</h2><p>We may love visuals almost as much as we love stories. Or perhaps we just need them to make sense of the world. Either way, introducing a visual aid right off the bat can be another powerful opening for a talk. Show a visual, pause, and then explain it. Choose a compelling chart or image that will make the audience curious to learn more. At the onset of her TED talk <em><a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/giorgia_lupi_how_we_can_find_ourselves_in_data\">How we can find ourselves in data</a>,</em> Giorgia Lupi shows this visual and says:</p><blockquote><p><em>This is what my last week looked like.</em></p></blockquote><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link is-viewable-img image2\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2210ee3-89ba-45f0-957f-b5a283e7c4bf_2864x1604.png\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2210ee3-89ba-45f0-957f-b5a283e7c4bf_2864x1604.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2210ee3-89ba-45f0-957f-b5a283e7c4bf_2864x1604.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2210ee3-89ba-45f0-957f-b5a283e7c4bf_2864x1604.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2210ee3-89ba-45f0-957f-b5a283e7c4bf_2864x1604.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2210ee3-89ba-45f0-957f-b5a283e7c4bf_2864x1604.png\" width=\"1456\" height=\"815\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f2210ee3-89ba-45f0-957f-b5a283e7c4bf_2864x1604.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:815,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:4922543,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2210ee3-89ba-45f0-957f-b5a283e7c4bf_2864x1604.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2210ee3-89ba-45f0-957f-b5a283e7c4bf_2864x1604.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2210ee3-89ba-45f0-957f-b5a283e7c4bf_2864x1604.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2210ee3-89ba-45f0-957f-b5a283e7c4bf_2864x1604.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" y1=\"3\" x2=\"14\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" y1=\"21\" x2=\"10\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">The visual Giorgia Lupi used to open her TED talk</figcaption></figure></div><p>She then moves on to explaining the chart and what she does, drawing a beautiful parallel between herself, data, and data humanism that she advocates for.
