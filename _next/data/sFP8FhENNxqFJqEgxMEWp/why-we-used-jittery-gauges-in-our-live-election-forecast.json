First, we wanted to convey the reality that our forecast was ‚Äúlive‚Äù ‚Äì connected to a live data feed and updating continuously, without any need for a user to refresh his or her browser. Movement helps convey that reality. This technique is common across the web, whether it‚Äôs on a site like chartbeat or a live gamecast of a baseball game. A ‚Äúlive‚Äù web page where nothing moves feels quite dead to the user. Second, we thought (and still think!) this movement actually helped demonstrate the uncertainty around our forecast, conveying the relative precision of our estimates. In our opinion, having the dial fluctuate a small amount ‚Äì bound by the 25th and 75 percentile of simulated outcomes ‚Äì was more successful at conveying the uncertainty around our forecast than simply listing what those percentiles were. As the night went on, the gauges fluctuated less and less as our forecast became more precise. By the end of the night, the gauges barely moved.</p><h2 id=\"why-didnt-you-just-show-the-chance-of-winning\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#why-didnt-you-just-show-the-chance-of-winning\"><span class=\"header-anchor\">#</span></a> Why didn‚Äôt you just show the chance of winning?</h2><p>The chance of winning is an important indicator that includes the uncertainty of the forecast. So why was that not enough? Well, the problem is that most people aren‚Äôt very good at interpreting a probability scale. While it is relatively easy to understand that a 50:50 chance is pretty high, and that a one in a million chance is pretty low, it is very hard to make sense of probabilities in between. How good is a 75% chance of winning? How much better is 85%? So rather than displaying just the chance of winning we wanted to show likely outcomes both in vote margin and electoral votes.</p><h2 id=\"why-didnt-you-just-display-the-median-outcome\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#why-didnt-you-just-display-the-median-outcome\"><span class=\"header-anchor\">#</span></a> Why didn‚Äôt you just display the median outcome?</h2><p>Because we thought that most people would read the median outcome as <em>the one</em> most likely outcome, as opposed to <em>one of many</em> very likely outcomes.

Feel free to add your thoughts to the comments.\n\n@tsiro: straight up: the NYT needle jitter is irresponsible design at best and unethical design at worst and you should stop looking at it\n(Nov 9, 2016)\n\n# Why did we let the gauge needles jitter?\nWe added movement in our gauges for two reasons.
