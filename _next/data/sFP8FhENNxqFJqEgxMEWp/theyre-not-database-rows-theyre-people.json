Since Latanya Sweeney’s initial work on <a href=\"http://latanyasweeney.org/work/identifiability.html\"><strong>de-anonymizing data</strong></a>, an entire industry has grown up around taking disparate pieces of information, both public and private, and matching them against each other to create alarmingly-detailed profiles of individual people. This is the foundation of the business model for Facebook, as well as <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/mobile-app-data-trackers/\"><strong>a broad swathe of other technology companies</strong></a>. This information includes <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html\"><strong>your location over time</strong></a>. And it’s available for purchase, relatively cheaply, by anyone who wants to target you or your family. Should we contribute, even in a minor way, to that ecosystem?</p>\n<p>These may seem like distant or abstract risks, but that may be because, for many of us, this harassment <a href=\"http://thescoop.org/archives/2019/03/09/the-more-important-problem/\"><strong>is more distant or abstract</strong></a> than it is for others. <a href=\"https://opennews.org/projects/2017-newsnerd-survey/\"><strong>A survey of “news nerds” in 2017</strong></a> found that more than half are male, and three-quarters are white (a demographic that includes myself). As a result of this background, many newsrooms <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/special_report/10-newsrooms-racial-disparity.php\"><strong>have a serious blind spot</strong></a> when it comes to understanding how their work may be seen (or used against) underrepresented populations.</p>\n<p>In particular, as rhetoric has ramped up over the last decade, it's become clear that newsrooms are not listening to the few trans journalists in their ranks. When the US \"paper of record\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nytimesguild/status/1441058412402548736\"><strong>fights back against updating historical bylines</strong></a> that contain their own reporters' deadnames, it sends a clear message about whose data matters, whose doesn't, and how seriously the institution takes the threat of personal metadata.</p>\n<p>We are very bad as an industry at thinking about <a href=\"https://datasociety.net/output/oxygen-of-amplification/\"><strong>how our power to amplify and focus attention is used</strong></a>. Even if harassment is not the ultimate result, publishing personal data may be seen by our audience as creepy or intrusive. At a time when we are concerned with trust in media, and when that trust is under attack from the top levels of government, more care is necessary.</p>\n\n                                                                      \n                            <h3>Names and shame</h3>\n<p>Ultimately, I think it is useful to consider our twin relationship to power and shame. Although we don’t often think of it this way, the latter is often a powerful tool in our investigative reporting. After all, as the fourth estate, we do not have the ability to prosecute crimes or create legislation. What we can do is highlight the contrast between the world as we want it to be and as it actually is, and that gulf is expressed through shame.</p>\n<p>The difference between tabloid reporting and “legitimate” journalism is the direction that shame is directed. The latter targets its shame toward the powerful, while the former is as likely to shame the powerless. In terms of accountability, it orients our power against the system, not toward individual people. It’s the difference between reporting on <a href=\"https://kdvr.com/2014/02/19/welfare-cash-pulled-from-atms-inside-colorado-pot-shops/\"><strong>welfare recipients buying marijuana</strong></a>, as opposed to looking at <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/marijuana/blacks-latinos-underrepresented-in-pot-shop-ownership/\"><strong>how marijuana licensing perpetuates historical inequalities from the drug war</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>Our audiences may not consciously understand the role that shame plays in our journalism, but they know it’s a part of the work. They know we don’t do investigations in order to hand out compliments and community service awards. When we choose to put the names of individuals next to our reporting, we may be doing it for a variety of good reasons (perhaps we worked hard for that data, or sued to get it) but we should be aware that it is often seen as an implication of guilt on the part of the people within.</p>\n\n                                                                      \n                            <p>This NPR database publishes the names and former addresses of Americans who took FEMA buyouts in disaster zones. The people named (in a fully downloadable database) are not guilty of crimes, or culpable for the mismanagement of the program itself.</p>\n\n                                                                      \n                            <p>In the small Virginia county where I went to high school, the local right-wing newspaper would publish the salaries of every teacher in the local public school system. There was no explicit threat of violence, but it was meant to feel invasive and hostile, and it did. When I worked at the Seattle Times and had conversations with editors about potentially creating a salary database for Washington State, it was hard to capture the difference between what we were doing, and what that Virginia paper had attempted to do. For the people named in those kinds of databases, it probably doesn't feel like there's really a difference at all.</p>\n\n                                                                      \n                            <h3>Toward a philosophy of PII in reporting</h3>\n<p>I want to be very clear that I am only talking about the public release of data when I ask for increased caution. I am <strong>not</strong> arguing that we should not submit FOIA or public records requests for personal data or that it can’t be useful for reporting. I’m also not arguing that we should not distribute this data at all, in aggregated form, on request, or through inter-organizational channels. It <strong>is</strong> important for us to show our work and to provide transparency. I’m simply arguing that we don’t always need to release raw data containing personal information directly to the public.</p>\n<p>In the spirit of Maciej Ceglowski’s <a href=\"https://idlewords.com/talks/haunted_by_data.htm\"><strong>Haunted by Data</strong></a>, I’d like to propose we think of personal data in three escalating levels of caution:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Don’t collect it!</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>When creating our own datasets, it may be best to avoid personal data in the first place. Remember, you don’t have to think about the implications of the GDPR or data leaks if you never have that information. When designing forms for story call-outs, try to find ways to automatically aggregate or avoid collecting information you will not use during reporting. I will note that this is often a tougher decision than it seems – consider, for example, the source diversity tracking that many newsrooms are now attempting to incorporate to diversify their coverage, which by extension often means gathering (and retaining) some degree of identifying data.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Don’t dump it!</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have the raw data, don’t just throw it out into the public eye because you can. In general, we don’t work with raw data for reporting anyway: we work with aggregates or subsets because that’s where the best stories live. What’s the difference in policy effects between population groups? What department has the widest salary range in a city government? Where did a disaster cause the most damage? Releasing data in an aggregate form still allows end-users to check your work or perform follow-ups. And you can make the full dataset available if people reach out to you specifically over e-mail or secure channels (but you’ll be surprised how few actually do). Note that even aggregated or anonymized datasets may be vulnerable to so-called <a href=\"https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/3/234925-understanding-database-reconstruction-attacks-on-public-data/fulltext\"><strong>Database Reconstruction Attacks</strong></a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Don’t leave it raw!</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In cases where distributing individual rows of data is something you’re committed to doing, consider ways to protect the people inside the data by anonymizing it without removing its potential usefulness. One approach that I love from <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/chicago-parking-ticket-data\"><strong>ProPublica Illinois’ parking ticket data</strong></a> is the use of one-way hash functions to create consistent (but anonymous) identifiers from license plates: the input always creates the same output, so you can still aggregate by a particular car, but you can’t turn that random-looking string of numbers and letters back into an actual license plate. As opposed to “cooking” the data, we can think of this as “seasoning” it, much as we would “salt” a hash function. A similar approach was used in the infosec community in 2016 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/21/16807116/infosec-community-sexual-predators-weinstein-assault\"><strong>to identify and confirm sexual abusers</strong></a> in public without actually posting their names (thus opening the victims up to retaliation).</p>\n\n                                                                      \n                            <h3>Policies, guidelines, and organizational support</h3>\n<p>The three \"don'ts\" above are rules that you can adopt for yourself or for a team that you lead inside a newsroom. They don't require institutional buy-in – they're like your code style or your team's best practice documents. But while ethics exist for ourselves, they are also historically a way that newsrooms establish trust and relationships with a community (see also: <a href=\"https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/journalism-essentials/bias-objectivity/lost-meaning-objectivity/\"><strong>the original development of \"objectivity\" as a method of verifying factual truths</strong></a>, not as an abstention from political life). And that means having a public policy.</p>\n<p>At NPR, sometime around 2019, I started the process of developing a set of public guidelines for the News Apps team. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to complete it before leaving the organization in 2021, due mostly to conflicts in scheduling and newsroom staffing availability. As a result, I can offer some guidance on what surfaced during this process so you may get further than I did.</p>\n<p>First of all, this is a conversation with many stakeholders. You'll want to talk with your legal department or counsel about any issues that they can foresee (including which terminology may prove binding, such as \"policy\" vs \"guidelines\"). You'll also want to bring in your standards department or copy chief, whoever is in charge of normally making coverage decisions. Your goal as a data journalist isn't to be the final decision maker but to be able to help inform the decisions that data-shy editors may need to make.</p>\n<p>Second, try to think about your process holistically. Your newsroom may already have a policy for redacting names from coverage or archives when there's a credible threat of violence or when circumstances have changed (say, a non-notable person is accused of a crime and later found innocent, but the original coverage still surfaces in searches for their name). I assume you're also already following (or are at least aware of) the <a href=\"https://transjournalists.org/style-guide/\"><strong>Trans Journalists Association style guide</strong></a> in terms of policies on redacting or altering deadnames. Having a personal data policy is a great way to unify your organization's approach when covering trans communities, people in the criminal justice system, and other communities that are normally shy about being in the journalistic spotlight.</p>\n<p>Third, try to think about how non-aggregate data is dangerous in combination and who has access to it. The ability to link names with addresses, geolocation or birth dates gives potential harassers more leeway to combine it with information obtained elsewhere. If it's possible to routinely delete or archive data in an inaccessible place at a preset time after publication (say, 90 days), you can lower the possibility of misuse by staff or inadvertent leaks. Internal systems, such as source diversity audits, should be designed so that reporters and staff cannot access the original data if it is retained.</p>\n<p>Finally, always consider how a public guideline or policy could be used by people acting in bad faith. For example, take into account those who will use the policy to try to make reporting on their actions more difficult, to manipulate the tone of your journalism or public figures who try to get coverage stricken. Spend time imagining how someone might try to abuse your rules, and then have conversations about how to respond ahead of time so that you're not trying to figure those situations out under pressure when – not if – it happens.</p>\n\n                                                                      \n                            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>\n<p>Once upon a time, this industry thought of computer-assisted reporting as a new kind of neutral standard: “precision” or “scientific” journalism. Yet as Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein point out in <a href=\"https://bookbook.pubpub.org/data-feminism\"><strong>Data Feminism</strong></a>, CAR is not neutral, and neither is the way that the underlying data is collected, visualized, and distributed. Instead, <strong>like all journalism, it is affected by concerns of race, gender, sexual identity, class, and justice.</strong></p>\n<p>It is also, for better or worse, often an extractive process. Databases serve as the ultimate way to parachute into a community and make pronouncements about it, specifically because they do often feel so all-encompassing. On <a href=\"https://dataviz.chalkbeat.org\"><strong>Chalkbeat's data team</strong></a>, we have tried to be conscious of the temptation to treat spreadsheets and public information as the story itself instead of relying on reporters who know and understand the locals' concerns, and can perform journalism with the community, not just on it. More importantly, <strong>we know that the way we publish today affects our ability to report within communities in the future, especially if they believe we're contributing to harassment, shaming, or abusive policy.</strong></p>\n<p>Incorporating an opinionated personal data strategy into our work gives data journalism a way to think about community-building and engagement. On a personal level, <strong>we can practice restraint in what we collect, dump, and publish in a raw form.</strong> As organizations, it's possible to <strong>create strong public commitments and policies on how we will handle identifying information for individuals.</strong></p>\n\n                                                                      \n                            <h3>Recommended resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Book: <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/28/17777330/internet-of-garbage-book-sarah-jeong-online-harassment\"><strong>The Internet of Garbage</strong></a>, by Sarah Jeong.

A survey of “news nerds” in 2017 found that more than half are male, and three-quarters are white (a demographic that includes myself). As a result of this background, many newsrooms have a serious blind spot when it comes to understanding how their work may be seen (or used against) underrepresented populations.\nIn particular, as rhetoric has ramped up over the last decade, it's become clear that newsrooms are not listening to the few trans journalists in their ranks. When the US \"paper of record\" fights back against updating historical bylines that contain their own reporters' deadnames, it sends a clear message about whose data matters, whose doesn't, and how seriously the institution takes the threat of personal metadata.\nWe are very bad as an industry at thinking about how our power to amplify and focus attention is used. Even if harassment is not the ultimate result, publishing personal data may be seen by our audience as creepy or intrusive. At a time when we are concerned with trust in media, and when that trust is under attack from the top levels of government, more care is necessary.\nNames and shame\nUltimately, I think it is useful to consider our twin relationship to power and shame. Although we don’t often think of it this way, the latter is often a powerful tool in our investigative reporting. After all, as the fourth estate, we do not have the ability to prosecute crimes or create legislation. What we can do is highlight the contrast between the world as we want it to be and as it actually is, and that gulf is expressed through shame.\nThe difference between tabloid reporting and “legitimate” journalism is the direction that shame is directed. The latter targets its shame toward the powerful, while the former is as likely to shame the powerless. In terms of accountability, it orients our power against the system, not toward individual people. It’s the difference between reporting on welfare recipients buying marijuana, as opposed to looking at how marijuana licensing perpetuates historical inequalities from the drug war.\nOur audiences may not consciously understand the role that shame plays in our journalism, but they know it’s a part of the work. They know we don’t do investigations in order to hand out compliments and community service awards. When we choose to put the names of individuals next to our reporting, we may be doing it for a variety of good reasons (perhaps we worked hard for that data, or sued to get it) but we should be aware that it is often seen as an implication of guilt on the part of the people within.\nThis NPR database publishes the names and former addresses of Americans who took FEMA buyouts in disaster zones. The people named (in a fully downloadable database) are not guilty of crimes, or culpable for the mismanagement of the program itself.\nIn the small Virginia county where I went to high school, the local right-wing newspaper would publish the salaries of every teacher in the local public school system. There was no explicit threat of violence, but it was meant to feel invasive and hostile, and it did. When I worked at the Seattle Times and had conversations with editors about potentially creating a salary database for Washington State, it was hard to capture the difference between what we were doing, and what that Virginia paper had attempted to do. For the people named in those kinds of databases, it probably doesn't feel like there's really a difference at all.\nToward a philosophy of PII in reporting\nI want to be very clear that I am only talking about the public release of data when I ask for increased caution. I am not arguing that we should not submit FOIA or public records requests for personal data or that it can’t be useful for reporting. I’m also not arguing that we should not distribute this data at all, in aggregated form, on request, or through inter-organizational channels. It is important for us to show our work and to provide transparency. I’m simply arguing that we don’t always need to release raw data containing personal information directly to the public.\nIn the spirit of Maciej Ceglowski’s Haunted by Data, I’d like to propose we think of personal data in three escalating levels of caution:\nDon’t collect it!\nWhen creating our own datasets, it may be best to avoid personal data in the first place. Remember, you don’t have to think about the implications of the GDPR or data leaks if you never have that information. When designing forms for story call-outs, try to find ways to automatically aggregate or avoid collecting information you will not use during reporting. I will note that this is often a tougher decision than it seems – consider, for example, the source diversity tracking that many newsrooms are now attempting to incorporate to diversify their coverage, which by extension often means gathering (and retaining) some degree of identifying data.\nDon’t dump it!\nIf you have the raw data, don’t just throw it out into the public eye because you can. In general, we don’t work with raw data for reporting anyway: we work with aggregates or subsets because that’s where the best stories live. What’s the difference in policy effects between population groups? What department has the widest salary range in a city government? Where did a disaster cause the most damage? Releasing data in an aggregate form still allows end-users to check your work or perform follow-ups. And you can make the full dataset available if people reach out to you specifically over e-mail or secure channels (but you’ll be surprised how few actually do). Note that even aggregated or anonymized datasets may be vulnerable to so-called Database Reconstruction Attacks.\nDon’t leave it raw!\nIn cases where distributing individual rows of data is something you’re committed to doing, consider ways to protect the people inside the data by anonymizing it without removing its potential usefulness. One approach that I love from ProPublica Illinois’ parking ticket data is the use of one-way hash functions to create consistent (but anonymous) identifiers from license plates: the input always creates the same output, so you can still aggregate by a particular car, but you can’t turn that random-looking string of numbers and letters back into an actual license plate. As opposed to “cooking” the data, we can think of this as “seasoning” it, much as we would “salt” a hash function. A similar approach was used in the infosec community in 2016 to identify and confirm sexual abusers in public without actually posting their names (thus opening the victims up to retaliation).\nPolicies, guidelines, and organizational support\nThe three \"don'ts\" above are rules that you can adopt for yourself or for a team that you lead inside a newsroom. They don't require institutional buy-in – they're like your code style or your team's best practice documents. But while ethics exist for ourselves, they are also historically a way that newsrooms establish trust and relationships with a community (see also: the original development of \"objectivity\" as a method of verifying factual truths, not as an abstention from political life). And that means having a public policy.\nAt NPR, sometime around 2019, I started the process of developing a set of public guidelines for the News Apps team. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to complete it before leaving the organization in 2021, due mostly to conflicts in scheduling and newsroom staffing availability. As a result, I can offer some guidance on what surfaced during this process so you may get further than I did.\nFirst of all, this is a conversation with many stakeholders. You'll want to talk with your legal department or counsel about any issues that they can foresee (including which terminology may prove binding, such as \"policy\" vs \"guidelines\"). You'll also want to bring in your standards department or copy chief, whoever is in charge of normally making coverage decisions. Your goal as a data journalist isn't to be the final decision maker but to be able to help inform the decisions that data-shy editors may need to make.\nSecond, try to think about your process holistically. Your newsroom may already have a policy for redacting names from coverage or archives when there's a credible threat of violence or when circumstances have changed (say, a non-notable person is accused of a crime and later found innocent, but the original coverage still surfaces in searches for their name). I assume you're also already following (or are at least aware of) the Trans Journalists Association style guide in terms of policies on redacting or altering deadnames. Having a personal data policy is a great way to unify your organization's approach when covering trans communities, people in the criminal justice system, and other communities that are normally shy about being in the journalistic spotlight.\nThird, try to think about how non-aggregate data is dangerous in combination and who has access to it. The ability to link names with addresses, geolocation or birth dates gives potential harassers more leeway to combine it with information obtained elsewhere. If it's possible to routinely delete or archive data in an inaccessible place at a preset time after publication (say, 90 days), you can lower the possibility of misuse by staff or inadvertent leaks. Internal systems, such as source diversity audits, should be designed so that reporters and staff cannot access the original data if it is retained.\nFinally, always consider how a public guideline or policy could be used by people acting in bad faith. For example, take into account those who will use the policy to try to make reporting on their actions more difficult, to manipulate the tone of your journalism or public figures who try to get coverage stricken. Spend time imagining how someone might try to abuse your rules, and then have conversations about how to respond ahead of time so that you're not trying to figure those situations out under pressure when – not if – it happens.\nLessons Learned\nOnce upon a time, this industry thought of computer-assisted reporting as a new kind of neutral standard: “precision” or “scientific” journalism. Yet as Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein point out in Data Feminism, CAR is not neutral, and neither is the way that the underlying data is collected, visualized, and distributed. Instead, like all journalism, it is affected by concerns of race, gender, sexual identity, class, and justice.\nIt is also, for better or worse, often an extractive process. Databases serve as the ultimate way to parachute into a community and make pronouncements about it, specifically because they do often feel so all-encompassing. On Chalkbeat's data team, we have tried to be conscious of the temptation to treat spreadsheets and public information as the story itself instead of relying on reporters who know and understand the locals' concerns, and can perform journalism with the community, not just on it. More importantly, we know that the way we publish today affects our ability to report within communities in the future, especially if they believe we're contributing to harassment, shaming, or abusive policy.\nIncorporating an opinionated personal data strategy into our work gives data journalism a way to think about community-building and engagement. On a personal level, we can practice restraint in what we collect, dump, and publish in a raw form. As organizations, it's possible to create strong public commitments and policies on how we will handle identifying information for individuals.\nRecommended resources\nBook: The Internet of Garbage, by Sarah Jeong.
