Text as labels is an example-packed chapter of just that (where our text is doing the job of the main point label) and in looking at the Distributions chapter, this time our text replaces the function of the actual bar or shape mark that’s encoding our metric. In other words, we’ve got text that looks like scatterplots, tile maps or bubble charts, followed by text that looks like bar charts or area charts.

And as we move through using text to display ratios and different layouts, we then come across “spark words” – including any number of the above methodologies where text is manipulated to facilitate the understanding of that text (for example using font weight as an encoding for city size).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel I haven’t done a great job of reviewing this book other than to convey the breadth and depth of text-related information in the book and my own pleasure at browsing through and having this great reference to hand for all things text and visualisation.
