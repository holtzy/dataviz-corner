But what if they gently mention some compelling details about who they are, woven into a neat storyline, while also pausing and asking you some questions? You&#8217;ll most likely want to engage more.</p><p>I recently realised that I react similarly when encountering a data visualisation for the first time.</p><p>Last week, I was browsing through the longlisted projects of the <strong><a href=\"https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/world-dataviz-prize-2023-poster-longlist/\">World Data Visualisation Prize</a></strong> (WDVP) &#8212; an initiative organised by Information is Beautiful and the World Government Summit. I took the time to click on every <strong><a href=\"https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/world-dataviz-prize-2023-poster-longlist/\">poster</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/world-dataviz-prize-2023-poster-longlist/\">interactive</a></strong> piece, and some of them felt inviting almost immediately. Others were a bit more of a struggle to engage with.</p><p>Which got me thinking: why is that? what makes or breaks the first encounter with a chart or infographic? what are the criteria for a good first impression?</p><p>I can name at least three.</p><h1>Alignment</h1><p>It&#8217;s no secret that we like symmetrical things. Gestalt theory of design analyses this: the human brain tends to perceive symmetrically balanced objects as more aesthetically pleasing. It also helps reduce cognitive load. Here&#8217;s an example from the WDVP entries &#8212; The Happymap by Alessia Musio. There are quite a lot of elements on the poster, but the effective layout grid makes it pleasant to navigate.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link is-viewable-img image2\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dc7d6bd-af16-4da2-b3ed-7ae58610e70f_2000x2828.jpeg\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dc7d6bd-af16-4da2-b3ed-7ae58610e70f_2000x2828.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dc7d6bd-af16-4da2-b3ed-7ae58610e70f_2000x2828.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dc7d6bd-af16-4da2-b3ed-7ae58610e70f_2000x2828.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dc7d6bd-af16-4da2-b3ed-7ae58610e70f_2000x2828.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dc7d6bd-af16-4da2-b3ed-7ae58610e70f_2000x2828.jpeg\" width=\"1456\" height=\"2059\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3dc7d6bd-af16-4da2-b3ed-7ae58610e70f_2000x2828.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:2059,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5713348,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dc7d6bd-af16-4da2-b3ed-7ae58610e70f_2000x2828.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dc7d6bd-af16-4da2-b3ed-7ae58610e70f_2000x2828.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dc7d6bd-af16-4da2-b3ed-7ae58610e70f_2000x2828.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dc7d6bd-af16-4da2-b3ed-7ae58610e70f_2000x2828.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" y1=\"3\" x2=\"14\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" y1=\"21\" x2=\"10\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">The Happymap by <a href=\"https://alessiamusio.com/\">Alessia Musio</a></figcaption></figure></div><h1><strong>White space</strong></h1><p>Creating enough white space is like remembering to pause. Can you imagine listening to someone who speaks so fast that they never stop to breathe? It would be overwhelming. Lack of empty space in design can make you feel the same. Increasing it, on the other hand, allows the user to think and digest. Below is an example from Lindsey Poulter &#8212; the interactive piece that was awarded the grand prize at the WDVP competition &#8212; with a little space between different chart elements.

There&#8217;s a long list of rhetorical devices &#8212; techniques that increase the persuasiveness of our writing and speaking &#8212; that include repetition of a letter, a word, or an entire sentence. For example, alliteration is when you start several words with the same letter in a single sentence. It seems to increase the effectiveness of the message. In data design, a similar outcome is often achieved by using consistent colour and typography. The infographic below by Raphael Hohr is a great example of using consistent design elements for section separators, labels, and titles. You only need to register what they mean once, and then the rest of the piece becomes easy to follow.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link is-viewable-img image2\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F811041dd-cb90-4124-8c58-7ce8f915d34b_2852x1212.png\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F811041dd-cb90-4124-8c58-7ce8f915d34b_2852x1212.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F811041dd-cb90-4124-8c58-7ce8f915d34b_2852x1212.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F811041dd-cb90-4124-8c58-7ce8f915d34b_2852x1212.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F811041dd-cb90-4124-8c58-7ce8f915d34b_2852x1212.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F811041dd-cb90-4124-8c58-7ce8f915d34b_2852x1212.png\" width=\"1200\" height=\"510.16483516483515\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/811041dd-cb90-4124-8c58-7ce8f915d34b_2852x1212.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:619,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:782102,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\" class=\"sizing-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F811041dd-cb90-4124-8c58-7ce8f915d34b_2852x1212.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F811041dd-cb90-4124-8c58-7ce8f915d34b_2852x1212.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F811041dd-cb90-4124-8c58-7ce8f915d34b_2852x1212.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F811041dd-cb90-4124-8c58-7ce8f915d34b_2852x1212.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" y1=\"3\" x2=\"14\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" y1=\"21\" x2=\"10\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">The light we switch on by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rafahohr\">Rafael H&#246;hr</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Is it worth talking about first impressions at all?

But what if they gently mention some compelling details about who they are, woven into a neat storyline, while also pausing and asking you some questions? You’ll most likely want to engage more.\nI recently realised that I react similarly when encountering a data visualisation for the first time.\nLast week, I was browsing through the longlisted projects of the World Data Visualisation Prize (WDVP) — an initiative organised by Information is Beautiful and the World Government Summit. I took the time to click on every poster and interactive piece, and some of them felt inviting almost immediately. Others were a bit more of a struggle to engage with.\nWhich got me thinking: why is that? what makes or breaks the first encounter with a chart or infographic? what are the criteria for a good first impression?\nI can name at least three.\nAlignment\nIt’s no secret that we like symmetrical things. Gestalt theory of design analyses this: the human brain tends to perceive symmetrically balanced objects as more aesthetically pleasing. It also helps reduce cognitive load. Here’s an example from the WDVP entries — The Happymap by Alessia Musio. There are quite a lot of elements on the poster, but the effective layout grid makes it pleasant to navigate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Happymap by Alessia Musio\nWhite space\nCreating enough white space is like remembering to pause. Can you imagine listening to someone who speaks so fast that they never stop to breathe? It would be overwhelming. Lack of empty space in design can make you feel the same. Increasing it, on the other hand, allows the user to think and digest. Below is an example from Lindsey Poulter — the interactive piece that was awarded the grand prize at the WDVP competition — with a little space between different chart elements. Feels just right, doesn’t it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do we compare? by Lindsey Poulter\nConsistency\nOddly, our brain also loves repetition. There’s a long list of rhetorical devices — techniques that increase the persuasiveness of our writing and speaking — that include repetition of a letter, a word, or an entire sentence. For example, alliteration is when you start several words with the same letter in a single sentence. It seems to increase the effectiveness of the message. In data design, a similar outcome is often achieved by using consistent colour and typography. The infographic below by Raphael Hohr is a great example of using consistent design elements for section separators, labels, and titles. You only need to register what they mean once, and then the rest of the piece becomes easy to follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe light we switch on by Rafael Höhr\nIs it worth talking about first impressions at all? We’re often taught not to trust them. Don’t judge a book by its cover, says common wisdom. And there’s some truth in that. But I’m sure you can name at least one friend today that you didn’t necessarily love at your first encounter. What if you hadn’t gotten a second chance to get to know them better? You’d certainly miss out.\nNot everyone will take a second look at your graphic. You may lose the opportunity to inform or even spark some action. \nSo why not pave the way for success right off the bat?\nThank you for reading The Plot ✨\nTalk next week,\n—Evelina\n\n\nNew: data storytelling course\nNext month, I’m running my very first data storytelling masterclass open to the public (yay!).
