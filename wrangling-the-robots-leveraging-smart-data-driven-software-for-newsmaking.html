The words are there, but you’re spending a lot of time pulling data. Too much, in fact, to do an interview.\nImagine you’re a local reporter for a regional news outlet tasked with covering multiple city council meetings that are happening on the same evening. How can you possibly be in three places at once?\nImagine you’re on the politics desk for a national newspaper and notice a peculiar phrase used by a politician at a press conference. You’re trying to get a sense of whether this is a dog whistle or a typo? How do you verify this?\nIn each of these scenarios, existing data-driven tools and software can help alleviate the pressure points for journalists in their day-to-day reporting.\nOne powerful thing that AI can do is write up and distribute summaries of city council meetings.\nWhile investigative journalists are doing innovative reporting with machine learning, the uptake has been uneven in journalism more generally, reported Charlie Beckett, professor of practice and director of the JournalismAI project at London School of Economics. Many services are developed using statistical modelling, sometimes called machine learning or “AI-powered,” available to newsrooms from third-party vendors.\nIn 2019, Beckett led a survey of 74 journalism organisations from around the world and found most newsrooms trialling AI are in the northern hemisphere. Reasons for the slow onboarding are varied, but many are fearful of job loss or deskilling, while smaller newsrooms face challenges related to skill and resources. \nWhile such fears are not without precedent, there’s optimism. In a podcast for Conversations with Data in July 2020, Beckett said, “If you want more time to get on with your journalism, then you better be in a newsroom where the boring bits are being looked after by a machine.”\nHow to leverage AI-powered services\nFind out who is sharing what\nFor journalists concerned with what is being shared online, the biggest players in Big Tech don’t make social analytics easy to come by. The main service available, CrowdTangle, is owned by Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook. Familiar to many audience development editors and social media teams, the tool can also help journalists identify stories or stamp out misinformation. \nUsing CrowdTangle, journalists can identify engagement with content, including which social media accounts have shared a specific URL hyperlink or keyword across social media (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and Instagram). Also available to the public is a hub of Live Displays, which offer a real-time view of trends on social media.\nCrowdTangle is a service from Meta that provides analytics about Instagram, Facebook, and Reddit. Above is a screenshot showing the tool in action.\nReporters and newsrooms can gain special access to more features from CrowdTangle by filing an access request. To get up to speed, journalists can check out a training programme from First Draft, a nonprofit that aims to protect communities from misinformation, to use CrowdTangle for research. Given how much a journalist's reporting relies on social media, such a tool is essential for verification and delivering fact-based reporting at speed.\nThe takeaway? Use it! It's free, and the barriers to entry are low. But like any data-driven service, the product won't give all the answers. CrowdTangle's metrics were decided by the parent company Meta. The Markup, an investigative newsroom, recently pulled back the curtain on CrowdTangle in \"How We Built A Facebook Inspector\". \nThey show that Meta does not provide impressions data or the number of times the content is shown to users, limiting what journalists can say about the information. In addition, keep in mind reporting on certain keywords or trends can inadvertently amplify them. Ethically speaking, this amplification could be problematic as it may unnecessarily spread uncertainty or fear to audiences.\nTranscribe audio\nThere are a range of free and paid transcription services newsrooms can use to report on live events such as city hall meetings, especially if they are online. Otter.ai uses artificial intelligence to provide real-time transcription and notes in easy-to-use file formats and direct language. Trint offers similar services. Reporters can upload a recorded audio file from Zoom or another video conferencing service, and the tools transcribe the file in written text. Reporters can listen to the audio file and edit the transcription file within the document for accuracy. Files can be shared with team members or exported. Trint is available in 14 languages.\nAbove is a screenshot showing the Trint display for editing an audio file.\nAccording to Aimee Rinehart, the AI program manager at Associated Press, these services may be helpful in places with a dearth of local media. \nRinehart referenced a conversation with Laura Frank, Executive Director of CoLab, about what small newsrooms are experiencing in southwest Colorado, where one news reporter is responsible for covering six counties.\n“That’s a tremendous task,” said Rinehart. “AI can help. One powerful thing that AI can do is write up and distribute summaries of city council meetings. For instance, provide a transcript, a summary. The public needs information about civic life.”\n“You look at things like voting habits, and they happen less in news deserts. The public needs information about civic life,” said Rinehart. \nThe takeaway: Transcription services are already a part of the workplace at many news media organisations. They save journalists time transcribing interviews, podcasts, or live meeting notes. In the case of “news deserts,” transcription bots could feasibly support newsrooms in doing the impossible: sending a reporter to three places at once. \nCosts range from free to enterprise rates in hundreds of US dollars. While versatile and already a part of many newsrooms, the transcripts may require human-powered copyediting to be publishable.\nAbove is a screenshot of Otter.ai taking live meeting notes via Zoom.\nServices and pricing:\nOtter.ai provides real-time transcription and note-taking in English. Pricing plans include a free plan to transcribe live, more services including transcribing files and using Otter.ai with third-party applications such as Zoom start at $20 USD per month. \nTrint provides transcription services in 54 languages on mobile and browsers. There’s no free version, but Trint does offer a 7-day free trial. Pricing plans for one user are $48 USD per month, while plans for up to 50 users are $68 USD per month.\nAutomate parts of newsmaking\nWhen freelance journalist Samantha Sunne worked at Reuters in the mid-2010s, she was tasked with writing oil industry reports. She spent a good part of her day tracking prices and preparing reports for a subset of subscribers involved in the oil industry. \n“’Oil went up by a half-cent, Oil went down by a cent,’ that kind of thing,” said Sunne. “If I have a robot making the lead for the oil price change reports and a script inserting the data, then I have time to do an interview.”\n Fast forward a decade, and according to Beckett, many larger newsrooms have smart automation services in place that write copy on topics such as pricing or sports. \nFor instance, The Associated Press has partnered with Automated Insights, a natural language generation platform, to automate earnings reports and sports articles.\nInvestments in these services can relieve journalists from tedious and time-consuming work.\nThe AP is also developing services in-house. Currently available is AP VoteCast, which provides localised coverage of election day with automated stories and graphics\nThe AP is currently at work on more scripting services, said Troy Thibodeaux, AP's director of digital news, in an email. The aim is to make it easier for partner newsrooms to auto-generate copy for specific states using up-to-date datasets.\nAI-powered software can be a helpful research tool. This is the hope of former journalist and author Maria Amelie, CEO and co-founder of Factiverse. This AI-powered browser add-on (try the prototype) fact-checks claims for journalists. Use the search bar to check specific claims or create a profile to fact-check an entire article. The source data is culled from the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN). Amelie's experience in journalism motivated her to develop the product.\n\"Journalists are spending hours on research to avoid making mistakes. There's a great deal of pressure on newsrooms to deliver many articles and to be fast. But there's so much content that they need to review -- millions and millions -- so our task is to make some of that easier,\" said Amelie. \nThe takeaway: In general, automation services from third-party vendors cost money, and prices vary depending on the services. But investments can relieve journalists from tedious and time-consuming work. \"On one hand, people don't want to get automated out of a job, but there's a place where drudgery can be relieved by AI,\" said Sunne.\nAP leverages machine-learning, among other techniques, to automate localised coverage of elections for newsrooms with AP VoteCast.\nKeeping robot writers at bay\nAI-powered robot writers stoke both fear and excitement. In 2012, Wired wrote that, according to Kristian Hammond, Chief Scientist at Narrative Science, an AI and natural language processing software developer, 90% of news would be written by robots in 2026. A decade on, does automated writing have a place in newsrooms? \nAbhishek Prasad, Head of Insights \u0026 AI and Automation at the HT Media Group, a mass media company based in Dehli, India, has experience trying to incorporate robot writers into newsmaking, and “believe me, we tried it, and the technology is absolutely not there.”\nI piloted two robot writers to understand better the tools, which promised to turn a blank page into copy ready to edit. Given I was working on this article, the proposal was appealing, and I popped these keywords into the online AI writer Rytr.me. It costs $29 USD per month and offers a free trial:\nRole of AI in the future of journalism. Artificial intelligence, bias, public good, moral compass, practical applications, diversity, clarity\nOut came copy—not unconvincing—but inaccurate:\nAI can take away all the bias from an article by detecting the correct keywords and synonyms. They also have a good moral compass to know what is in the public’s interest and what not to report. It is important to note that AI writers do not have a sense of bias, which is something that has been a concern when it comes to journalism in the past. With AI writers, there is no need to worry about bias in any shape or form.”\nAbove is a screenshot of the Rytr.me settings and copy from fall 2021 on the topic of “The Role of AI and the Future of Journalism.” Rytr is available in thirty languages and can write content for a variety of settings, such as blogs, emails, and social media posts. Here is what text came out:\nIt turns out this robot isn’t a terrible writer, but a terrible reporter. Most of the above are inaccurate. But the copy could feasibly fool a distracted reader. And it doesn’t take an ethicist to say that’s problematic. \nNext, I tried Copy.Ai using the same keywords. This company was recently awarded $11 million USD in Series A venture capital. The robot writer costs $35 USD/month to use and offers a one-week free trial.\nPictured above is a screenshot of the Copy.ai settings and copy on the topic of “How to use AI for journalism.” The software offers several settings to adjust and is available in 25 languages.\nThe software pushed out several paragraphs of copy, including a section referencing Microsoft and Associated Press, but something seemed off. There was no context. \nI stopped there to do an internet search, which led me to a 2017 Poynter piece by Sunne.\nAbove is a screenshot of copy written by Copy.ai.\nHer story was summarised in a line, without references. Where did it come from? Who can use this writing? \nI sent an email to Chris Lu, CEO of Copy.ai, asking about the training data and the rights to re-use. His reply was enthusiastic: \n\"All of our content is AI-generated! You don't need to credit Copy.ai at all, and it's your work, especially if you make edits after generating it with Copy.ai!\" He confirmed by email that their robots are trained using about 10% of the internet, including Wikipedia articles.\n\"Those robots are straight up stealing,\" Sunne said jokingly in an email when I contacted her. Thieves, perhaps, but sloppy ones. It wasn't any December, but December 2017; AP didn't \"join forces\" with Microsoft but used a Microsoft application as a part of a \"non-financial collaboration.\" The pilot is also over. \nThe takeaway: Robot writers can stoke the imagination with copy, but results can be sloppy and require additional research to provide necessary nuance and fact-checking. \nKeep in mind robot writers could be misused and amplify the production and circulation of false or misleading information online, which impacts journalism and society. \nPush for robot-generated copy to be labelled, and AI transparent in general, as the Council of Europe demands in a June 2021 declaration. \nAs long as robots are one tool in the toolbox and not responsible for the ethics statements that will guide their adoption, they can, as Beckett hopes, allow journalists to do more creative work. This includes using machine learning to hold governments and corporations to account.\nWill this headline make you mad?\nStatistical modelling has been used for more than a decade to predict which headlines will garner clicks, using the logic of Search Engine Optimisation, and more recently, emotional resonance to predict engagement on social media platforms.
