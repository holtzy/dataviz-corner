Tell them that they shouldn’t do it because it is absolutely and objectively wrong to make non zero based bar/column/area charts. It’s way more than a convention, it’s a sacred law.\nThat’s why a good charting tool would never allow users to make bar/column charts with truncated bar lengths, but give them the free choice not to include zero in a line chart if think it’s better without[2].
